# ðŸ’¼ Job Search Automation Framework

This project is a **Java Selenium automation framework** that scrapes **job details** from a job listing website based on a **user-specified keyword**, and writes the extracted data into an **Excel file** using the Apache POI library. 

Project is integrated with Jenkins, such that whenever a push is made to GitHub, the jenkins job runs and sends an Email to the Recipients with the Excel file attached to it.
