# 💼 Job Search Automation Framework

This project is a **Java Selenium automation framework** that scrapes **job details** from a job listing website based on a **user-specified keyword**, and writes the extracted data into an **Excel file** using the Apache POI library.

---

## 📌 Features

* ✅ Built using **Selenium WebDriver**
* ✅ Implements **Page Object Model (POM)** for modular and maintainable code
* ✅ Searches job listings based on a **given keyword**
* ✅ Navigates through **multiple browser tabs**
* ✅ Extracts job-related details like:

  * ✅ Company Name
  * ✅ Job Title
  * ✅ Location
  * ✅ Closing Date (or any other required fields)
* ✅ Writes the extracted data into an **Excel (.xlsx)** file
* ✅ Uses **Apache POI** for Excel file handling
* ✅ Easily extendable for other websites or data points

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The framework launches a browser using WebDriver.
2. Navigates to the job website.
3. Searches for jobs based on the provided **keyword**.
4. Opens relevant job postings (even in new tabs).
5. Extracts key job information.
6. Writes the information to an Excel sheet (`JobResults.xlsx` or similar).
